# Front-end Projects from High School

## About
The projects made in this repository was made during high school where I had classes in the subjects called Informatics Technology 1 & 2.
In that period of my life, I've acquired the skills of programming basic websites in HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
This repository consists of all my poorly written code from when I first started coding in 2019 and 2020.
It's only meant for showcasing what I have learnt throughout the years of my programming career.
Gradually I got better at coding in front end, especially in JavaScript, which I hope you will be able to see within the files.

Now that I am a post-graduate from OsloMet University, I would say that I'm a lot better at front end and totally up-to-date in other web technologies like Angular and React.
